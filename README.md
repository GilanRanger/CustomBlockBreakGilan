# CustomBlockBreakGilan
Custom Block Break Plugin

The plugins reset does not work, as I need to use configs to save the block data to be replaced later, and I will probably use bukkit runnables or a system where I wait till a certain number of blocks are mined to reset them.


So only the BlockBreakListener is in use.
